Hi, I'm Abdul Basit 👋

I have a background in mobile application development and I’m currently
exploring core computer science concepts using Python, with a focus on
systems, algorithms, and applied machine learning.

This GitHub reflects my learning journey through small experiments,
simulations, and projects.

### Currently working on
- CPU scheduling simulator (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin) in Python
- Learning operating systems concepts through implementation
- Strengthening Python for problem-solving and experimentation

### Areas I'm exploring
- Operating systems and scheduling
- Distributed systems fundamentals
- Machine learning basics
- System performance and trade-offs

### Featured projects
- CPU Scheduling Simulator – Python-based simulation of classical OS schedulers
- (More projects will be added as I continue learning)

I'm documenting my progress openly to stay consistent and improve
my understanding step by step.
