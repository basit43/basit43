Hi, I'm Abdul Basit 👋

I’m a full-time mobile application developer with 3 years of experience
building and shipping production-grade Flutter applications for Android
and iOS.

Alongside my professional work, I’m intentionally strengthening my core
computer science foundations using Python, with a focus on systems,
algorithms, and applied machine learning.

### Professional focus
- Flutter & Dart (MVVM, Clean Architecture, BLoC/Provider/GetX)
- Real-time mobile systems, APIs, and performance-aware app design
- End-to-end app lifecycle: development → deployment → store release

### Currently building (Python / CS foundations)
- CPU scheduling simulator (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin) in Python
- Learning operating systems concepts through implementation
- Strengthening Python for problem-solving and experimentation

### Areas I’m expanding into
- Operating systems and scheduling
- Distributed systems fundamentals
- Machine learning
- System performance and trade-offs

### Featured projects
- CPU Scheduling Simulator – Python-based simulation of classical OS schedulers
- Selected Flutter projects (production apps and platforms)

I document my work openly to stay consistent, deepen my understanding,
and build strong fundamentals over time.
